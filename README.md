# LeetCode Solutions (Rust)

This repository contains a curated collection of LeetCode solutions written in Rust,
with a focus on clarity, correctness, and maintainable documentation.

The repository is updated daily as part of a personal challenge to solve one
LeetCode problem per day.

## Statistics

- **Total problems:** 5
- **Difficulty breakdown:**
  - Easy: 1
  - Medium: 3
  - Hard: 1

> This is a documentation-focused repository.  
> Individual problems are documented in detail under the `problems/` directory.

## Repository Structure

```text
leetcode-rs/
├── solutions/        # Original Rust solution files (source of truth)
├── problems/         # Auto-generated per-problem documentation
├── src/              # Analysis-only crate root (rust-analyzer)
├── tools/            # Synchronization tooling

└── README.md         # Repository overview
```

## Tooling and Synchronization

A custom synchronization tool (`sync_leetcode`) is used to keep solution
files, documentation, and metadata in sync.

```bash
cd ~/leetcode-rs
rustc tools/sync_leetcode.rs -O -o tools/sync_leetcode
./tools/sync_leetcode
./tools/sync_leetcode 100
```

---

## Scope and Design Goals

- Readable and idiomatic Rust solutions
- No execution or benchmarking
- Deterministic, auto-generated documentation
- Strong IDE support via rust-analyzer

---

## Notes

- `solutions/` is the single source of truth
- Files under `problems/` and `src/` are auto-generated
- Manual edits to generated files will be overwritten

---

## Credits

- Problem statements and metadata were sourced using:
  - https://github.com/clearloop/leetcode-cli
- All solutions are authored and maintained manually.
