# LeetCode Solutions (Rust)

This repository contains a curated collection of LeetCode solutions written in Rust,
with a focus on clarity, correctness, and maintainable documentation.

The repository is updated daily as part of a personal challenge to solve one
LeetCode problem per day.

> A browsable web version of this repository is available on the [project website](https://mzyui.github.io/leetcode-rs//).

## Repository Structure

```text
leetcode-rs/
├── docs/             # Auto-generated documentation
├── solutions/        # Original Rust solution files (source of truth)
├── problems/         # Auto-generated per-problem documentation
├── src/              # Analysis-only crate root (rust-analyzer)

└── README.md         # Repository overview
```


## Tooling and Synchronization

A custom synchronization tool (`sync_leetcode`) is used to keep solution
files, documentation, and metadata in sync.

```bash
cd ~/leetcode-rs
rustc tools/sync_leetcode.rs -O -o tools/sync_leetcode
./tools/sync_leetcode
./tools/sync_leetcode 100
```


## Scope and Design Goals

- Readable and idiomatic Rust solutions
- No execution or benchmarking
- Deterministic, auto-generated documentation
- Strong IDE support via rust-analyzer


## Notes

- `solutions/` is the single source of truth
- Files under `problems/` and `src/` are auto-generated
- Manual edits to generated files will be overwritten


## Credits

- LeetCode platform
- leetcode-cli by clearloop ([GitHub repository](https://github.com/clearloop/leetcode-cli))
- Tooling (`sync_leetcode`) was developed with assistance from an AI language model (ChatGPT, GPT-5).
