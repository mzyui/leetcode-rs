# Gemini Code Assistant Context

This document provides context for the `leetcode-rs` project to the Gemini code assistant.

## Project Overview

`leetcode-rs` is a Rust project that serves as a personal collection of solutions to LeetCode problems. The primary focus of this repository is on creating clean, readable, and well-documented Rust code for each solution.

A key feature of this project is its automated documentation system. A custom tool, `tools/sync_leetcode.rs`, is used to parse the solution files and generate a comprehensive set of Markdown files, including this `README.md`, detailed problem descriptions, and a `src/lib.rs` file for `rust-analyzer` support.

The project is structured as follows:

-   `solutions/`: This is the main directory containing the raw Rust solution files. Each file is self-contained and includes the problem description and metadata as comments. This is the **source of truth**.
-   `problems/`: Contains Markdown files for each problem, generated by the sync tool.
-   `docs/`: Contains the files for the GitHub Pages website, also generated by the sync tool.
-   `src/lib.rs`: An auto-generated file that includes all the solutions. This is not meant for compilation but to provide a single entry point for `rust-analyzer` to correctly analyze all the code.
-   `tools/`: Contains the `sync_leetcode.rs` script for content generation.

## Building and Running

This project is not intended to be built or run in a traditional sense. There are no runnable binaries or libraries produced. Its main purpose is code analysis and documentation.

The core development workflow revolves around the `sync_leetcode.rs` tool. To update all the generated documentation after adding or modifying a solution, run the following commands:

```bash
# Compile the tool
rustc tools/sync_leetcode.rs -O -o tools/sync_leetcode

# Run the tool to update all generated files
./tools/sync_leetcode
```

To run the tool for a specific problem number, you can pass it as an argument:
```bash
./tools/sync_leetcode <problem_number>
```

## Development Conventions

-   **Solutions as Source of Truth**: All solution files are located in the `solutions/` directory. When adding a new solution, create a new file in this directory. The file name should follow the format `<problem_number>.<problem-slug>.rs`.
-   **Metadata Comments**: Each solution file must begin with comments that specify the problem's metadata, such as `Category`, `Level`, and `Percent`. The problem description itself should also be included as comments.
-   **Auto-generated Files**: Any changes made directly to files in `problems/`, `docs/`, or `src/lib.rs` will be overwritten the next time the `sync_leetcode` tool is run.
-   **Code Style**: Code is formatted using `rustfmt`. The `sync_leetcode` tool automatically applies `rustfmt` to the code blocks in the generated documentation.
