# 11. Container With Most Water

**Category:** algorithms\
**Difficulty:** Medium\
**Acceptance:** 59.234516%

**LeetCode:** [View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

## Problem

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

## Examples

#### Example 1

- **Input:** height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
- **Output:** 49
- **Explanation:** The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

#### Example 2

- **Input:** height = [1,1]
- **Output:** 1

## Constraints

- n == *height.length*
- **2** <= n <= **10**⁵
- **0** <= *height[i]* <= **10**⁴
