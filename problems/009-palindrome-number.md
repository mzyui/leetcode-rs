## Examples

### Example 1

- **Input:** x = 121\
- **Output:** true\
- **Explanation:** 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

### Example 2

- **Input:** x = -121\
- **Output:** false\
- **Explanation:** From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

### Example 3
